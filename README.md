# 🧙‍♀️ Playing Around With dbt Cloud 🧙‍♂️

What kind of wizardry is this?

> The best kind.

I'm running this in a `dbt Cloud` free trial so don't expect any significant updates or maintenance. kbye! <3

## Setup

We love [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) so you can get started with `poetry install` and activate your new shell with `poetry shell`.
Have fun!

### Almost fun

What's currently missing is a `profiles.yml` configuration for this project.
We do not need to maintain a [`profiles.yml`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/profiles.yml/) file in this repo, since this is running on `dbt Cloud` and its taking care of those configs.

### Using the starter project

**To do this you need to setup your own [`profiles.yml`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/profiles.yml/).**

Try running the following commands:
- `dbt run`
- `dbt test`
