# 🧙‍♀️ Playing Around With dbt Cloud 🧙‍♂️

What kind of wizardry is this?

> The best kind.

I'm running this in a `dbt Cloud` free trial so don't expect any significant updates or maintenance. kbye! <3

## Setup

We love [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) so you can get started with `poetry install` and activate your new shell with `poetry shell`.
Have fun!

### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- `dbt run`
- `dbt test`
